## 介绍
项目为Apache Tomcat 9.0.75
用于测试整体web环境使用
### 编译过程
1. 安装apache ant 1.10.2 以上版本
2. 执行ant ide-intellij
3. 使用idea打开
具体见 [wlzjdm的博客](https://www.cnblogs.com/wlzjdm/p/6972121.html)
> 1. java/debug文件夹为本人测试编写代码使用
> 2. 使用方式是将编译后的class文件放入webapps文件夹中，以适当的方式组织目录结构，即可访问该class文件处理的请求
> 3. lib文件夹为使用ant ide-intellij编译过程中下载的依赖包，一并上传方便下次拉取使用
> 4. build.properties文件定义了编译时依赖下载到的具体文件夹，因为下载时开启了代理，所以需要在其中定义proxy信息，具体见BUILDING.txt文件
